# **Build a Local/Online AI Code Assistant with LLaMA 3B and QLoRA INT4**

## **The Problem**

AI-powered coding assistants have revolutionized software development, enhancing speed and efficiency. However, most require cloud-based processing, raising concerns about data privacy and security. Every function, variable, and line of code you input is sent to an external server‚Äîposing a major risk for industries handling proprietary, confidential, or sensitive data, such as finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity.

***The challenge is clear:***

How can developers leverage AI-driven coding assistance without compromising data privacy?

This project presents a local-first AI coding assistant that runs entirely on your own machine, keeping all processing private while still benefiting from AI-powered automation.

# **The Solution: Phyton Like A Pro**

**Core Technologies**
To build this AI coding assistant, Im going to use:

LLaMA 3B ‚Äì A lightweight, open-source model for code generation.

QLoRA INT4 ‚Äì Efficient fine-tuning that reduces memory consumption by 4x, enabling performance on low-resource environments.

Hugging Face & Gradio ‚Äì A simple, interactive web interface for developers, deployed on Hugging Face Spaces with an offline download option for privacy.

Google Colab ‚Äì For fine-tuning and experimentation.

This setup ensures all computations remain local, with an optional web deployment that doesn‚Äôt require cloud uploads.

# **How the Assistant Works**

My AI-powered coding assistant:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Understands natural language prompts to generate relevant Python code.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Runs locally, eliminating data leakage risks.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Uses Gradio for an intuitive web-based interface, while also allowing offline use to protect proprietary code.
